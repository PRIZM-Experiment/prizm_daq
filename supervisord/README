Intro
=====

This directory contains all the scripts and configuration files needed
to run the PRIZM DAQ using supervisord.  When running in supervised
mode, the SNAP and housekeeping RPIs will automatically start DAQ
processes as soon as they boot, and supervisord will ensure that those
processes stay alive and are restarted in the event of a crash.  If
there are too many crashes on an RPi, it will reboot and attempt
starting the DAQ again.

Before doing anything, make sure supervisord and dependencies are
installed on the RPi.  In principle, you should only need meld3 and
supervisord itself.  The software packages are saved on the PRIZM
laptop under ~/software/meld3-1.0.2.tar.gz and
~/software/supervisor-master.zip.  Unpack these into /usr/local/src
and install both with "sudo python setup.py install".

By default, the scripts below are configured to write log files to
~/supervisord_logs.  Ensure that this directory exists.


Contents of this directory
==========================

./run_daq_supervised.py :
Main top-level script.  This is the supervisord equivalent of
run_daq_auto.py and automatically figures out which Pi we're on and
which DAQ command to run.  Rather than invoking the DAQ directly, this
script is a wrapper for calling "supervisord -c <file.config>".

./kill_daq_supervised.py :
General script for killing all instances of supervisord and the PRIZM
DAQ in case there are stray processes.  Use this script to ensure
complete process termination.

supervisord_[70MHz,100MHz,housekeeping].conf :
Supervisord configuration files.  These contain the actual DAQ
commands that are called -- keep an eye out for semi-hardwired
absolute paths.

./prizm_daq_listener.py :
Supervisord listener script used by the above configuration files.
Listens for crashes and executes a reboot command if too many crashes
have accumulated.  The default setting is 5 crashes before reboot.

./rc.local :
Example rc.local file for executing run_daq_supervised.py
automatically upon boot.  Copy the relevant lines into /etc/rc.local
(and ensure that the file ends with the exit(0) statement).
